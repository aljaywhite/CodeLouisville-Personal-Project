# CodeLouisville-Personal-Project
Personal project for Code Louisville

This is a one page site for a local band.

As of now all information such as merchandise and show dates are placeholders, and the site requires further back-end work for the form data.

********FORM SUBMISSION********
As of now the form data is not set to go anywhere i.e. action="".
Upon clicking "Send" an alert will display that says "SERVER UNAVAILABLE. PLEASE TRY AGAIN LATER".
Click "okay" to close the form, and the forms success message will display.


If you have any questions I can be reached at aljaywhite23@gmail.com
